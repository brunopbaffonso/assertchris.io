If you’re been following me on Twitter, you’ve probably seen a bunch of tweets about this thing I’ve been working on; called Gitstore. I’ve grown fond of describing it as a way to sell code that doesn’t entirely suck.

Along with a couple friends, I’ve been building Gitstore to make it easy for maintainers to sell and distribute their code. I won’t go into detail, now, except to say that I am still excited to be working on it. I can’t think of a single project I’ve worked on as much as this, without making a cent, and still been happy…

I bring it up because there are a few things I’m doing, in the codebase, which I haven’t done before. Approaches to design and architecture which are new to me, and may be useful for you.

### Responders vs. Controllers

I’m not the first person to suggest any of this stuff, least of all responders. The R in [ADR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action%E2%80%93domain%E2%80%93responder) is this exact thing. Each of my routes are defined like this:

```php
Route::get('/subscriptions', Subscriptions\ShowSubscriptions::class)
    ->name('subscriptions.show');
```

> This is from `routes/web.php`

Each responder handles a single combination of request method and URI. These classes have an `__invoke` method, and can define other functions they need to use to get the job done:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Users;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Socialite;

class ReauthenticateGithub extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
        $user = auth()->user();

        $this->revokeGithubToken($user);
        $this->removeGithubDetails($user);

        request()->session()->put('is_seller', true);
        request()->session()->put('redirect_to_github_sync', true);

        return $this->redirectWithNewPermissions();
    }

    private function revokeGithubToken($user)
    {
        $token = $user->github_token;

        $clientId = config('services.github.client_id');
        $clientSecret = config('services.github.client_secret');

        $client = new Client();

        $client->request('DELETE', "https://api.github.com/applications/{$clientId}/tokens/{$token}", [
            'auth' => [$clientId, $clientSecret],
        ]);
    }

    private function removeGithubDetails($user)
    {
        $user->github_id = null;
        $user->github_handle = null;
        $user->github_token = null;
        $user->github_authed_at = null;
        $user->save();
    }

    private function redirectWithNewPermissions()
    {
        return Socialite::driver('github')
            ->scopes(['repo'])
            ->redirect();
    }
}
```

There’s definitely some improvement to be made to this responder, now that I’m looking at it again. I can inject the `Illuminate\Http\Request` object, so I don’t need to use `request()` or `auth()`. I can inject the Socialite provider, so I don’t need to use the facade.

Still, I think this illustrates how much smaller intricate sets of functionality can be packaged.

### Components and Includes

When Shawn join the team, we started to design the UI. Until that point, all the UI was whatever worked at the time I built it. This meant we needed to rebuild lots of front-end markup.

We started to take a component-based approach to design. I found it surprisingly difficult to decide which sub-views should be includes and which should be components. Finally, I settled on a criteria. I ask whether the thing I’m building will be a) reused to build another component, and b) has content that is a natural focus.

Here’s an example of the first:

```html
<div class="flex ml-4 md:ml-0 mt-4 items-center">
    {{ $slot }}
</div>
```

> This is from `resources/views/new/components/actions.blade.php`

This component holds the buttons beneath each form. Any actions specific to the current page are usually in this area. They look like this:

![](/images/2018-10-31-13-57-11.png)

Here’s an example of the second:

```html
<span class="flex bg-indigo-light text-white text-sm rounded-full px-3 py-1">
    {{ $slot }}
</span>
```

> This is from `resources/views/new/components/bubble.blade.php`

We often show things like subscription prices (and other meta data), using little round bubbles. They look like this:

![](/images/2018-10-31-14-16-30.png)

If the view doesn’t easily fit into these two categories, I tend to make it an include. It probably needs more than a single piece of data to work. It probably doesn’t need to be reused.

### Declarative front-end

Javascript constitutes 0.04% of the codebase. It’s virtually non-existent, here. When I do need it, I follow the kind of approach I used to use with MooTools:

![](/images/2018-10-31-14-22-30.png)

When I want something to happen, on the front-end, I trigger it with custom data attributes in the markup sent from the server. I’m also using a light build of jQuery, so the behaviours look like this:

```js
$("[data-submit-sibling]").on("click", function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    $(this)
        .siblings("form")
        .submit();
});
```

> This is from `resources/js/behaviors/submit-sibling.js`

I use this behaviour to submit the forms which allow method spoofing for `DELETE` requests. I should probably add a Blade directive to make those forms, but I haven’t got to that yet.

I stitch these behaviours together, in the main Javascript file:

```js
const axios = require("axios");

// ...usual laravel stuff

require("./behaviors/allow-payment");
require("./behaviors/disable-link-on-click");
require("./behaviors/dismiss-status");
require("./behaviors/submit-sibling");
require("./behaviors/show-plan-form");
require("./behaviors/show-subscriber-chart");
require("./behaviors/toggle-header-menu");
```

> This is from `resources/js/app.js`

I can’t believe I’ve been able to get away with so little Javascript in a commerce app. 257 lines…

Well, that’s all I have to show you today.
