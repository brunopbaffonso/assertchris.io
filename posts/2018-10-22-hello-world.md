## Hello world

It’s customary, when launching a new ship, to smash a bottle of champagne over the bow. Apparently the wasted bottle is meant to invite good luck. Perhaps it’s because there will be less alcohol for the captain to drink on that first voyage…

# Hello world

Similarly, it’s customary when launching a new blog, to publish a post entitled “hello world”. I guess it’s because most first programs involve the printing of these two words.

Hello world.

This is not the first time I’ve written, though. And, for the longest time I have avoided hosting my own platform. Medium just always seemed like less of a hurdle. I didn’t have to worry about how to see post stats, or whether I would have an outage or not. I never had to consider what would happen if they were hacked.

Then, I stuck my nose in [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd/status/1054261069802336256). It sent me down the familiar rabbit hole.

1. “How will I design it?”
2. “What if it goes down?”
3. “Maybe I should leave it for another time…”

Only…this time I think I’m going to follow through. I know all the reasons why _I should host on my own platform_. Those thoughts constantly clash with fear of the work involved to create and maintain my own site. This time, though, I am motivated by the desire to see how the fear holds up to reality. And, to show my internet friends that “the guy who writes” can actually…you know.

I planned for this to be longer. Oh well. Perhaps I’ll talk about how this blog was built. Now, that’s a tale…
